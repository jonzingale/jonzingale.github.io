## Module for exploring monadic properties with Discrete Dynamical Systems

### Product type (M = 𝝥.𝜟) monadic dynamical systems
- M takes a dynamical system and returns its cartesian square
- η finds the diagonal inclusion in M
- 𝜇 flattens square onto its factor

### Setup:
1. run local server: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
2. navigate to http://localhost:8000/dyanamical.html
